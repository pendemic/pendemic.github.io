After about a month break of using SQL, I decided that it was time to go back and refresh on it.
I opened up my old study material started going through it and pretty much spent the entire day looking through it.
I was amazed with how much I had forgotten in such a little time, unpleased with this realization, I started looking into ways that
I could study it and implement it into an every day drill. So I found this really helpful site called Hacker Rank. This site 
allows you to do coding challenges for the languages they have provided and just my luck mySQL was one of them. I started tackling
these challenges right away and realized that I still got it! I will continue to use this resource to sharpen my SQL and maybe even
learn something new. Now I just need to find this for all of my languages...
