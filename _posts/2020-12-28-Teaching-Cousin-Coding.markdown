So I had a talk with some of my cousins last night that are also interested in a career in technology. One of my cousins is currently learning UI/UX and my
other cousin is about to start school for game script design. I showed my cousin thats interested in game design my dungeon application that I built with C# 
and he seemed really interested and decided that he wanted a little knowledge for coding before he started school. So i'm going to teach him so of the basics
of C# and see how it goes.
