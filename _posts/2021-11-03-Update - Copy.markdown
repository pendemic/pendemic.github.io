This is a long overdue update but I'm gonna keep it short and sweet. I recently interviewed for a Application engineer. I had a total
of 3 interviews. One in person, one technical and a coding challenge. Although I wasn't selected for the role, it was still a great
experience overall. I met a really great person named Jason who gave me a lot of good advice and overall was just very nice to me
throughout the process. As far as coding goes, I realized that I want to take a step back to understand data structures a lot more.
I am going to continue doing coding challenges and watching some youtube videos to continue my learning process. Jason also gave me
some good advice about looking into message based architecture so I'm gonna give that some time as well. Gonna be updating this a lot
more often so I can document my growth and activity a lot better. Signing off for today. Until next time.
