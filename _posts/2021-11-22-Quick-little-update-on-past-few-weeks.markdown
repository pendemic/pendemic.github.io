    <title>Quick little update on past few weeks</title>

Over the past few weeks I've been seeking advice from my friend named Jake. He has been a software engineer for a while now and he's
been giving me some tips on what to study as well as the interview process as a whole. I went over to his house to study and learned 
a ton. I was able to use my time efficiently and also change my area of study. Recently I've been pretty interested in algorithms
and I'm starting to find the coding challenges on HackerRank not only fun but they are also getting easier for me. The next thing
that I am really gonna dig into is data structures. I've used them a ton in my coding challenges so it'll be useful for me.
Also Jake is thinking about starting a Linux class that I'm interested in learning more about.
