Finally came up with a little idea for a new project. It's not going to be too complicated but it'll definitely be a good
project to keep me busy/refresh my skills again. My idea for the project:
A data driven application that allows the user to select types of alcohol that they have and list out different cocktails
they can create with it. I plan to show pictures of the cocktails, ingredients to make, and a link for more information
and detailed instructions for making the drink. I'll give myself 2 weeks to finish this project and will post updates regularly.
