<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Four Pillars of Object Oriented Programming</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Basic Terminologies</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Object</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> - Instance of a class/ working entity of a class. Objects don't need to be created if the class has static methods.</span></p>
<p><strong>Class</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> - This is the model or standard about the capability of what an object can do. Classes do not consume memory.</span></p>
<p><strong>Method</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> - Can modify a class state that would apply across all the instances of a class</span></p>
<p><strong>Instance </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">- These are like Objects. A blueprint for a car design is the class description, all the cars manufactured from that blueprint are objects of that class. Your car that has been made from that blueprint is an instance of that class.</span></p>
<p><strong>Constructor</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> - Is a special method whose name is the same as the class name. Serve to initialize objects.</span></p>
<p><strong>Interface</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> - A special type of class that contains methods but not their definitions. You cannot create objects, you need to implement that interface and define methods for implementation.</span></p>
<p><strong>Abstract Class</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> - special class containing abstract methods. The abstract methods inside are not implemented, only declared. So when a subclass inherits the class they need to define and implement them.</span></p>
<p><strong>Difference</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> - </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The main difference between the two is that, when an interface is implemented, the subclass must define all its methods and provide its implementation. Whereas when an abstract class is inherited, the subclass does not need to provide the definition of its abstract method, until and unless the subclass is using it</span></p>
<p><strong>Access Modifiers</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> - Special keywords that control the accessibility of entities like classes and methods. Examples - Public, Private. Play a vital role in achieving encapsulation.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Four Principles of OOP:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Encapsulation</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Encapsulation is when each object inside of a class maintains a private state. Other objects can not access this state directly, instead they can only invoke a list of public functions. In order to communicate with the object, you will need to utilize the methods provided. To bind things. Example: A vending machine. You request a bag of chips from the machine and it gives you chips. The vending machine is a class and contains methods for its mechanisms and operations. They are all encapsulated in the vending machine.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Data Hiding - Hides unwanted information, such as restricting access to any member of an obj</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Data Binding - binding the data members and the methods together as a whole, as a class</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Abstraction</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Abstraction is an extension of encapsulation. It is the process of selecting data from a larger pool to show only the relevant details to the object. An advantage to abstraction is being able to apply the same information to other applications with little or no modification. Example: Driving a car. You do not need to know the details on how the engine works or how your transmission works to drive the vehicle. You only need to know functions like how to steer or how to put the car in drive. This is abstraction because you are choosing only the relevant details that you need to operate the vehicle. Also being able to apply these details to other vehicles and being able to operate them with little to no modification.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Inheritance</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Inheritance is the ability to acquire some/all properties of another object. Example: An Apple can inherit properties from a fruit class such as having seeds. But then the apple sub class would contain details such as being red, round and having a stem.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sub class - An entity which inherits from another class, child class</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Superclass - An entity which allows subclasses or child classes to inherit from itself.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Polymorphism</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Polymorphism gives us a way to use a class exactly like its parent so there is no confusion with mixing types. Each child sub class keeps its own functions/methods as they are. To use something in different forms. Example: We use milk for drinking but it can also be used for other things like making curd or butter. Example(2):Function overloading - In which you use the same name but the operations are different.</span></p>
<p><br /><br /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why use OOP:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Helps users to understand the software easily, although they don&rsquo;t know the actual implementation.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The readability, understandability and maintainability of the code increase multifold</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Big software can be easily written and managed easily using OOPs.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Helpful in solving complex problems</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Promotes code reuse, reducing redundancy</span></li>
</ul>
