So far I think this project is goiing really well! Suprisingly I remember a lot more than
I thought I did, and have only ran into a few speed bumps. I am going to write them down
here so that in the future I can use this post as a reference lol. First one being using 
Visual Studio's built in source control. I found out that I need to create a blank solution
first then add the src file, then add my layers within that folder. Second thing was adding 
the Data layer, I didn't have much issues setting it up but I forgot that I needed to add
a reference after it was all said and done. Other than that things have been going smoothly
and I'm excited to continue working on this project. Will update more soon!
