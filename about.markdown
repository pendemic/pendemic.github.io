Hello all! My name is Mikeo Skinner and this is my blog. Here I will be posting about new things that I learn about as well as taking some personal notes for myself.

A little bit about myself:
I am a full stack web developer in the .NET framework. I spent 3 years in college. 2 years at JCCC studying computer science and knocking out some prereqs and 1 year at KU
majoring in computer science as well. After that I attended Centriq Training and there I got hands on experience learning how to build data driven web applications. I finished
training there in July and have been job searching ever since. As far as my hobbies go, I like to breakdance and practice my coding skills by doing daily coding challenges.

Welcome to my blog!
